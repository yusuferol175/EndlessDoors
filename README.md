# EndlessDoors
 Endless Doors is a 2D platform mobile game where you earn score based on the difficulty level you choose. In this game, at the beginning of each round, three randomly generated paths are created. The difficulty level of these paths is determined by the presence of monsters, health packs, and weapons, and it is shown to the player. The player chooses a door, and if they successfully complete that path in proportion to its difficulty level, they can earn a higher score. May/2022
